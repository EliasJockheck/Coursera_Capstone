In other words i want to predict the possibiity of you getting into a car accident and predict the possible severity of the accident on top. In order to make such predicitons i would take different attributes like weather or road conditions into account. In the end, given the prediction, you could drive more carefully or if possible even change you travel route.\n\nOur Target audience is the SDOT Traffic Management Division. They could use the data they are already collecting and analyze which are the main drivers for accidents happening in certain areas. On top it is possible to calculate the influence of the main factors that lead to accidents. Knowing the main factors and their influence the objective is to define measurements that improve for example road conditions or light conditions. Lets say our analysis shows that severe accidents happen because of bad light conditions in a certain area the SDOT can take actions to improve these conditions and hopefully lower the future number of accidents.\n\nSo in clonclusion the furhter analysis should help SDOT to identify the main drivers and their influence. And of course the SDOT's main objective should be to lower the number and the severity of accidents. "
